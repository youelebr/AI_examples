Here it has been translate in C.

This perceptron tries to predict if a person is diabetic or not by observing three information,
obesity, smoking habits, and exercise habits of five persons.

The dataset looks like this:
Person	    Smoking   Obesity  Exercise  Diabetic
Person 1        0       1         0         1
Person 2        0       0         1         0
Person 3        1       0         0         0
Person 4        1       1         0         1
Person 5        1       1         1         1


It is a very simple neural network with one input layer and one output layer.
